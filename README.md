Results
-------

* **K-Means**: Best segmentation with 5 clusters  
* **Hierarchical (Complete Linkage)**: Performs better with 3 features  
* **DBSCAN & Mean Shift**: Less optimal but reveal interesting patterns  

### Identified Clusters:

1. Low income, high spending  
2. Medium income, medium spending
