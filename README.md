🛍️ Customer Segmentation Using Mall Customer Dataset
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on segmenting mall customers into distinct groups based on their age, annual income, and spending score using unsupervised machine learning algorithms. The goal is to help marketing teams design targeted campaigns and improve store profitability.

🚀 Features
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

✅ Data preprocessing and normalization

✅ Implementation of multiple clustering algorithms:

K-Means

DBSCAN

Hierarchical Clustering (Complete Linkage, Average Linkage)

Mean Shift

✅ Comparison of clustering performance using metrics such as Silhouette Score

✅ Business insights and marketing strategies for each customer cluster

📂 Dataset Overview
Source: Kaggle – Mall Customer Segmentation Data

Records: 200 customers

Features:

CustomerID – unique identifier

Gender – categorical (excluded from clustering)

Age – numerical

Annual Income (k$) – numerical

Spending Score (1–100) – numerical

Gender was excluded from clustering to avoid misleading results in distance-based algorithms like K-Means.

🧠 Key Findings
K-Means (k=5) segmented customers into five groups based on income and spending patterns.

Hierarchical Clustering (Complete Linkage) gave the best results when including age as a third feature.

Younger customers tend to have higher spending scores.

Marketing strategies were designed for each identified cluster to maximize profitability.

📊 Business Value
By analyzing customer clusters, businesses can:

Deliver personalized offers to high-value customers

Improve conversion rates

Optimize marketing budgets

Enhance operational efficiency
